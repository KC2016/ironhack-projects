We build reliable, highly scalable and highly performing distributed systems for data analytics on Azure. We work with various open-source technologies like Hadoop, Yarn, etc., and make contributions to these technologies. We are creating a planetary scale storage system, which can scale to Exabyte of data (yes, thatâs 18+ digits!). Azure services is building next generation globally distributed, elastic scale, multi-model cloud database services. It is designed to enable developers to build planet-scale applications. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to be part of a very agile team, take on hard distributed system problems and ship high impact features at a rapid pace. As an engineer, you have an opportunity to work on the latest technology in compute and container hosting to build a massively scalable unified cloud service framework, get to work on heterogeneous transport protocols, apply innovative algorithms for solving placement and load balancing problems at scale. We need collaborative developers who can think big, deliver on those big challenges, and along the way, change the world.\\n\\nAZDAT #ENGGJOBS\\n\\nAbility to meet Microsoft, customer and/or government security screening requirements are required for this role. These requirements include, but are not limited to the following specialized security screenings: Microsoft Cloud Background Check: This position will be required to pass the Microsoft Cloud background check upon hire/transfer and every two years thereafter.\\n\\nMicrosoft is an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to age, ancestry, color, family or medical care leave, gender identity or expression, genetic information, marital status, medical condition, national origin, physical or mental disability, political affiliation, protected veteran status, race, religion, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected by applicable laws, regulations and ordinances. We also consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements. If you need assistance and/or a reasonable accommodation due to a disability during the application or the recruiting process, please send a request via the Accommodation request form.\\n\\nResponsibilities\\nWeâre looking for engineers to build them from the ground up. Want to change the world with data and large-scale distributed systems? Do you want to solve challenges that you didnât even know existed until you get to a large size? Come join us on the Azure Big data team! âBig dataâ is an acronym for collecting and processing massive data sets (viz., Petabyte scale) that is a becoming a well-established industry pattern. Apache Hadoop has become the industry standard for storing and computing on this data, and Microsoft is building Hadoop related services on Azure. CISL (Cloud and Information Services Lab) is deeply engaged with Microsoftâs Big Data teams (Cosmos, Hadoop). We are focused on several projects that build on the latest version of Hadoop/YARN and support analytics platforms such as Hive and Storm that are part of the Hadoop OSS ecosystem. Joining the CISL team is a fantastic opportunity to work with some of the best scientists/engineers in the industry who have had hands-on experience with managing Hadoop at scale. The group members have been involved with the Hadoop project for several years. Some of the software we build has already been released to the open source community. In particular, we built Rayon, a layer that adds resource reservation/planning and contributed the code back to Apache YARN. The CISL group has a strong bent towards innovation, tackling open problems, building novel solutions, and publishing papers. The team culture is results driven, and values collaboration and building robust shipping code. Efforts in the group range from developing novel ideas, to building prototypes for validation, to contributing code that runs in production settings, to publishing research papers in top conferences. As a Scientist in CISL, you will work with a talented team of scientists/engineers to design and develop Hadoop-related services on Azure. This is a great opportunity to learn YARN, HIVE, Storm, and other OSS technologies and contribute to the code base, while also leveraging Microsoft cloud technologies such as Azure. The systems you build will used to power some of our biggest internal customers (such as, Skype, Bing). We are looking for candidates with systems building skills with a bent towards doing publishable research.\\nQualifications\\nBasic Qualifications: Ph.D in Computer Science or IT technical discipline\\n\\nPreferred Qualifications: â¢ Experience with distributed computing, Big data processing, Hadoop, etc. is a plus, but not a requirement â¢ A strong publication record with results obtained by building working systems is a plus.   \n",
